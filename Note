* Struct = a map that is used to store data in elixir
  * advantage from map = can be assigned default values

* Note on struct
We aren't required to pattern match every key and value in a map/struct.
The opposite is true when using a list.

In short:
Lists require us to consider each element.
Maps/Structs do not require us to consider each key/value pair.

* To reference a function, we use:
 *  |> Enum.map(&mirror_row/1)
